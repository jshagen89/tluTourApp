Tschoepe also houses our Business, Education, Kinesiology, Athletic Training, and Dramatic Media departments. If you're in Tschoepe Hall talking to friends or having a Starbucks coffee at the coffee shop, you may also want to stop by and talk to our Director of International Education about Study Abroad. We have programs with over 200 universities in 54 countries, including our most popular Study Abroad program at Harlaxton College in England. Each semester, we have a TLU professor who travels with students and teaches a class at Harlaxton.</string>
