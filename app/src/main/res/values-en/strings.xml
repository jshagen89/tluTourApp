    <string name="martin_luther_statue_info">Our \"Learn Boldly. Live to Inspire\" mission is inspired by the actions of Martin Luther who was a German monk and Catholic priest and a key figure in the Protestant Reformation. Like Luther, TLU embraces the value of inquiry, critical thinking and creativity.\n\nThe foundation of a Lutheran education is to help students develop their talents and use them to fill the world\'s greatest needs. TLU students Learn Boldly and Live to Inspire just as Martin Luther did.\n\nThis statue of Martin Luther was designed by a TLU art professor and sculptor and stands at the entrance to the Beck Building where you\'ll find our Office of Admissions and Financial Aid, Business Office, Registrar and administrative offices.</string>
